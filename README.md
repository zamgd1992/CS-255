This is a business requirements document and a system design document for DriverPass.
DriverPass wants a system that helps them give extra help to students that are wishing to get their driver license.
They offer practice tests, online course materials to study from and in-person training.
The training is both an in-person class and on the road training. 
The system would need to let students sign up and purchase a package that includes a combination of these services. 
They also need access to the tests, materials and be able to sign up for a time for their in-person training.

I provided clear communication in both documents to describe the design of the DriverPass system.
Using a template each document is separated into sections that help the reader find a particular area of the design. 

It is important to realize that good design comes from an iterative process. 
The work done in both documents is the first iteration of the design. 
Having more time, I would wish to go back through and refine the design.
I would particularly like to revisit the security of the system as the current design does not have enough focus on this area.

The business requirements document focusses on the clients needs. 
It is important figure out the needs of the client and focus on these needs when designing a system. 
Any software is designed for the client what they want must come first.

Designing software first begins by collecting data on what the current processes are.
Then you must consider the clients needs and look at ways to improve the current processes.
After You understand the client and their processes you can begin looking at improving those processes or systems.
The most important technic of any design process is iteration.
It is impossible to get everything perfect on the first try, which is why iteration is so important.
As we work through the design we will inevitable learn new things about the system and find better ways to improve the system.
